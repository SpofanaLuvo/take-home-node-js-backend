# Introduction

Hello ðŸ‘‹,

Thanks for taking the time to complete this brief take-home assignment.

The goal of this exercise is to evaluate your backend skills in developing lean microservices in JavaScript (Node.js, ExpressJS, 3rd-party integration, and testing). Feel free to make any assumptions, simplifications, or other changes to the problems - though please state those in your write up when you submit this assignment. Please use as many libraries as is reasonable - there is no sense in rebuilding what has been built. Feel at liberty to structure the microservice in a way that satisfies you.

Using and Express.js you will create a REST endpoint that talks to a database(Relational/Non-relational).

Before getting started, please read this document carefully.

**Good luck ðŸ™ƒ**
